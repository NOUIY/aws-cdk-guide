# cdk notices<a name="ref-cli-cmd-notices"></a>

Display notices for your CDK application.

Notices can include important messages regarding security vulnerabilities, regressions, and usage of unsupported versions.

This command displays relevant notices, regardless of whether they have been acknowledged or not. Relevant notices may also appear after every command by default.

You can suppress notices in the following ways:
+ Through command options. The following is an example:

  ```
  $ cdk deploy --no-notices
  ```
+ Suppress all notices indefinitely through context in the project’s `cdk.json` file:

  ```
  {
    "notices": false,
    "context": {
      // ...
    }
  }
  ```
+ Acknowledge each notice with the `cdk acknowledge` command.
